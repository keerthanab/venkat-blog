venkat-blog
===========

yay! first attempt in designing a minimal blog for a friend!





HOW TO RUN? 
(Assuming you have git installed - if not do it first)

Open up your terminal and follow below steps

1) git clone https://github.com/keerthanab/venkat-blog.git

2) cd venkat-blog 

3) Note that I have used a different font for text. Goto venkat-blog/public/fonts folder. From that install 'waterfalls' font - you may not be having it on your system

4) node app.js
(After this you should now be seeing that the server started from the terminal message displayed)

5) open browser and hit localhost:3000
