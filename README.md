venkat-blog
===========

yay! first attempt in designing a minimal blog for a friend!





HOW TO RUN? 
(Assuming you have git installed - if not do it first)
git clone https://github.com/keerthanab/venkat-blog.git
cd venkat-blog 

(Note that I have used a different font for text. Goto public directory and check fonts folder. From that install 'waterfalls' font - you may not be having it on your system)

node app.js
(You should be seeing that the server started from the terminal message)

open browser and hit localhost:3000
